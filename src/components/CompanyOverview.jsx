                            The Addis Ababa Saving and Credit Association for Employees (AA-SCAE) is a financial institution established in 2003 EC] to serve the saving and credit needs of employees in Addis Ababa. Since itâ€™s founding the Addis Ababa Savings and Credit Association (AA S&CA) has been a beacon of financial empowerment for government employees in Addis Ababa. Operating as a non-profit organization, the AA S&CA prioritizes member well-being over maximizing profits. This commitment is reflected in the interest rate that is 7.5 percent for borrowers. In its years, the AA S&CA saw a staggering increase in membership, enrolling about 302 government employees. This surge can be attributed to two key factors. Firstly, the AA S&CA offered its member service in the dire time of high inflation rate in Ethiopia. Secondly, the Association addressed a critical need by introducing salary-deduction savings accounts with interest rates consistently 7.5 percent. This allowed members to grow their savings significantly. Additionally, the AA S&CA offered microloans with a remarkable repayment rate, featuring interest rates significantly lower than traditional lenders, making them a viable option for essential needs.                    </p>

                            we have emerged from a growing recognition of the need for affordable financial services, access to savings opportunities, or loan options for employees.

Over the years, the AA S&CA has experienced a steady growth and increasing membership]. This growth can be attributed to [commitment to member service, adaptation to changing needs.                    </p>
